## Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course

### Overview:

This file explains how the **run_analysis.R** script should work. It assumes you have:  
  - **[R]** and **[RStudio]** already installed in your computer, and
  - **[dplyr]** package already installed.
  - Connection to the internet, as it may need to download some packages.

### Version:

1.0

### Execution Steps:

1) Ensure your working directory is the root of this project.  
2) In the current directory you should see:  
* **UCI HAR Dataset** - Directory  
* **README.md** - This flatfile you are reading right now.  
* **run_analysis.R** - A ".R" script that will be executed to generate the **tidy data**. 
* **tidyData.txt** - (OPTIONAL) A text flatfile that will contain the **tidy data** generated by **run_analysis.R** script.  

3) Fire up the **[RStudio]**.  
4) Execute **source("run_analysis.R")** within **[RStudio]**.  
5) You should see an output similar to the following:  

> If it is the very first time you execute this steps in your current session, some extra messages might
> appear warning you about some masked objects in the **[dplyr]** library!

```
   + get.clean.and.tidy.df...
   |--- get.and.clean.subject.df...
   |    |--- reading [ subject test ] data...
   |    |--- reading [ subject train ] data...
   |    \--- munging subject data...
   |--- get.and.clean.label.df...
   |    |--- reading [ label test ] data...
   |    |--- reading [ label train ] data...
   |    |--- reading [ activity description ] data...
   |    \--- munging label data...
   |--- get.and.clean.measure.df...
   |    |--- reading [ measure test ] data...
   |    |--- reading [ measure train ] data...
   |    \--- munging measure data...
   |--- get.and.clean.feature.df...
   |    |--- reading [ feature ] data...
   |    \--- munging feature data...
   |--- munging all data...
   |--- tidying all data...
   |--- writing file tidyData.txt with contents of tidy.df...
   |--- housekeepping the environment...
   \--- end.

   Look the contents of [tidy.df] data frame! Bye!
```

5) To read the generated text flatfile with the **tidy data** execute:  

```
        tidy.df <- read.table( "tidyData.txt" , header = TRUE , sep = " " )
        dim(tidy.df)
        str(tidy.df)
        summary(tidy.df)
```
