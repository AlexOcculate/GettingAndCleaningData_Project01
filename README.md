## Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course 
### Project Assignment

This file explains how the run_analysis.R script should work.
It assumes you have R and RStudio already installed in your computer and connection to the internet as it may need to download a specific package.

This assignment uses data from <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>


1) Ensure your working dir is the root of this project.  
2) In the current directory you should see:  
    - UCI HAR Datase - Directory  
    - README.md - This flatfile you are reading right now.  
    - run_analysis - A ".R" script that will be executed to generate the 'tidy data'. 
    - tidyData.txt - (OPTIONAL) A text flatfile that will contain the 'tidy data' generated by 'run_analysis.R' script.  
3) Fire up the RStudio.  
4) Execute source("run_analysis.R") within RStudio.  
6) You should see an output similar to the following:  

```
   + get.clean.and.tidy.df...
   |--- get.and.clean.subject.df...
   |    |--- reading [ subject test ] data...
   |    |--- reading [ subject train ] data...
   |    \--- munging subject data...
   |--- get.and.clean.label.df...
   |    |--- reading [ label test ] data...
   |    |--- reading [ label train ] data...
   |    |--- reading [ activity description ] data...
   |    \--- munging label data...
   |--- get.and.clean.measure.df...
   |    |--- reading [ measure test ] data...
   |    |--- reading [ measure train ] data...
   |    \--- munging measure data...
   |--- get.and.clean.feature.df...
   |    |--- reading [ feature ] data...
   |    \--- munging feature data...
   |--- munging all data...
   |--- tidying all data...
   |--- writing file tidyData.txt with contents of tidy.df...
   |--- housekeepping the environment...
   \--- end.

   Look the contents of [tidy.df] data frame! Bye!
```

5) To read the generated text flatfile with the 'tidy data' execute:  

```
        tidy.df <- read.table( "tidyData.txt" , header = TRUE , sep = " " )
        dim(tidy.df)
        str(tidy.df)
        summary(tidy.df)
```
